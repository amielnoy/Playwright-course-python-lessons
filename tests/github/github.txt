# Module 3: Git,GitHub on PyCharm & CLI
# Git and GitHub Basics

# Explanation: Git and GitHub are essential tools for source control in test automation. They allow you to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of your codebase.

# Examples:

COMMIT:
git commit -m "Add login test case"

# Records changes made to the codebase.

PULL:
git pull origin main


Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the local branch.
PUSH:
git push origin main

Uploads changes from your local repository to the remote repository.
MERGE:
git merge feature-branch

Combines changes from another branch into the current branch.


PULL REQUEST (GitHub):
A pull request is used to propose changes from one branch to another and allows for code review and discussion before merging.
Exercise Questions:

Commit Exercise: Create a new Python file in your test automation project, make changes, and commit the changes using Git.
Pull & Push Exercise: Clone an existing repository, make modifications, and push the changes to the remote repository.
Pull Request Exercise: On GitHub, create a feature branch, make changes, and open a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch.
